# Crosscut Metadata Repository

Tools and documentation for encoding CFDE-DCC metadata into DATS JSON.

## Metadata Model

The aim of the crosscut metadata model is to provide a uniform
encoding of metadata gathered from the CFDE data repositories. The
crosscut metadata model is based on a JSON-LD encoding of
[DATS](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201759). DATS, the DatA
Tag Suite data model, was developed through the Big Data To Knowledge
(BD2K) initiative to support dataset discoverability. Several
extensions to DATS, along with schema.org and OBO Foundry-based
JSON-LD context files, have been developed to support the crosscut
metadata model. Some of these extensions and context files can be found 
in the DATS GitHub repository at https://github.com/datatagsuite.
