Pared-down GTEx v7 example DATS JSON-LD files that contain only 1
subject and 2 samples. These files were generated by modifying the
code from https://github.com/dcppc/crosscut-metadata to limit the
number of subjects and samples in the output. 

Each JSON-LD file has two variants, one with JSON-LD id references and
one without JSON-LD id references. The latter are denoted with "_norefs"
in the filename. These files do not use JSON-LD id references and 
have been validated as DATS-compliant using the DATS validator from 
https://github.com/datatagsuite/dats-tools.

The files *with* id references lack the "_norefs" designation and 
cannot be validated because the DATS validator does not support all
id references. However, these files should be identical to their 
"_norefs" counterparts, except for the inclusion of id references
(including possibly circular references, as per the DCPPC DATS encoding.)
